Instead of having to close connection and cursor and delete the cursor you can use with to automatically do this.

```
    with pyodbc.connect("Driver={SQL Server Native Client 11.0};""Server=Server\Instance;""Database=DB;""Trusted_Connection=yes;") as connection:
        with connection.cursor() as Inscursor:
            Inscursor.execute('Query Goes Here')

            data = Inscursor.fetchall()
